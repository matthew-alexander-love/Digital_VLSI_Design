## Digital VLSI Design Lab Algorithms
These are a automation algorithms for partitioning and oreantation of submodules
on an SoC.

Kernighan-Lin: A partitioning algorithmn used to split systems into 2 groups and
minimize the number of edges between the 2 partitions.

Stockmeyer: Find the optimal orientation of blocks in a floorplan to minimize the
total area
